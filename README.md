# The-Punisher-v2
**WIP Source Code for The Punisher v2**

This plugin is a WIP revamp of my old punisher plugin that I have had in development on and off for the past 3 or 4 years now.
I have finally decided to focus on developing this plugin fully and have realised that there are some critical errors/mistakes
that I have made in the previous code structure that I would like to hopefully amend in this new revamp of the plugin. 
I also hope to add in a tonne of new features to it that will help with customizability and just make it more stable overall.

I am planning on commenting a large portion of this code to make it easier for other developers and users to read and figure out
why things are the way they are. I also plan to commit and push changes as I make them rather than waiting to push them and then just
pushing everything to github at once.

This version is planned to solely run on bungee 1.8+ with a possible stand-alone bukkit version in the future for people who don't 
want to have to run bungeecord on their server in order to use this plugin.

#### Below is a copy of the punisher v1 readme most of this stil applies apart from the changes mentioned above


This plugin is my biggest and oldest plugin that I have had in production on and off for the past 3 or 4 years now.
Most of the code seems unfinished, uncommented and unrefined because I haven't been able to work on it 
for a good while and when I have I was unable to fix many bugs or finish features that I was working on.

~~This code is also behind by a couple versions and missing some unfinished classes as I didn't want to put the
code publicly on github until I was sure it worked and was ready for the public.~~

This code is not meant to be the most efficient by any means, it is just how I like to code my plugins, 
and I am aware I have some old pieces of code left in from when I had terrible coding habits (_These will
 hopefully be removed and sorted in this version_).
so that I understand and can read my code easier, that being said I do welcome constructive criticism.

The Punisher version 1.8-LEGACY is the latest stable version for 1.8-1.12.2 and will no longer have
new features added, only MAJOR bugs fixed. Future versions of the punisher will support 1.13+.
