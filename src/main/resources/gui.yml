# TODO: 9/11/2020 this can probably replace all the classes in com.i54m.punisher.objects.gui also separate files for each or no?
# pseudo code for creating guis:
# for each key in this file:
#  construct a gui based on defined values
#  store gui with name (key) in a hashmap
#
# then need to figure out how to integrate that into current design of menus
